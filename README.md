# Diffusion-based generative model for laser plasma particle acceleration simulation

This repository contains the implementation and testing of a conditional Denoising diffusion implicit model capable of simulating the laser wakefield accelerator experiments.

For training, use the train.py script. For image generation, use the sample.ipynb file.

Installation:

conda create --name "name" python=3.10.12
