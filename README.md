# Diffusion-based generative model for laser plasma particle acceleration simulation

This repository contains the implementation and testing of a conditional Denoising diffusion implicit model capable of simulating the laser wakefield accelerator experiments performed at ELI Beamlines. The two best model checkpoints can be found in the following link:
